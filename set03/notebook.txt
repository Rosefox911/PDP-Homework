																							I assume I am going to need at least 2 helper functions for every problem that handles an inventory and an order.

2/5		JD		9:00		15:00			0					1				480			I ran into a very interesting issue. I was first handling an order and an inventory. However, in the main function I was doing list decomposition on the inventory
																							and on the helper, on order. This resulted in it going through inventory, and once it finished, it would return the inventory.
																							This was a problem because there could be duplicate lineitems in order, after the last entry. 
																							Took me a while ti figure out the issue, I ended up just doing list decomposition on order first, then inventory.
																							This resolved the issue

2/6		JD		20:00		23:00			0					1				180			I finished adding the finishng touches to inventory, made sure I had full test coverage and that all the design recipe (as well as template recipe) was there.

2/7		JD	9:00		13:00				0					2				240			I began working on the second problem, obviously in this one I will only have to handle a single list (ListOfBalls),
																							It shouldn't be much harder than inventory, I will need to recursively draw things onto the scene.
																							I think I might have several helpers, one that handles the ListOfBalls, one that handles a specific ball. I would pass the ListOfBalls recursively to the one that handles
																							a single ball.

2/9		JD	11:00		20:00				0				2					540			I have finished, for the most part, problem 2. However, I am running into issues with recursively adding things to the scene. I can't figure out how to add new elements, without
																							deleting the old ones. I think I'll take another look at problem 1, and see how I managed it there. It should be working, but its not.

2/10	JD	12:00		16:00				0				2					240			I finished adding the finishing touches to problem 2 programs. I also adde several constants to handle the testing.
																							In the examples section, the problemset didn't always print the exact input, instead it described it.
																							I did this for several of my examples, however in the test section, I made it print the result.
																							I am wondering if I can use constants for expected outputs, but so far, we have only used them for "magic numbers"
																							expected outputs do not fall into that category.
