																						After posting on piazza, 
																						I realized that in order to modify a structure, 
																						I would have to recreate it and define the construction as a variable. This was a huge help.
																						
1/21	JD		19:00	24:00		0				1,2						5			I continued working on questions 1 and 2. 
																						Knowing how to manipulate structures, they became easy. For question 1, I defined several helper functions. 
																						I need to ask the TAs if this is permitted.
																						
1/23	JD		10:00	12:00		0				3						2			I am trying to find out a way to do string compares on 																								
																						variables with a string in Racket. 
																						I need this in order to determine if its a diff or mult.

1/23 	JD		12:00	16:00		0 				3						4			I realized that when a struct is made, it provides functions, 																						  
																						primarily structname? which helped me determine which struct 																							
																						I was dealing with.

1-24	JD		12:00	15:00		0 				2,3						3			After the class on the 23rd, I realize that I hadn't 																								
																						implemented the design recipe correctly. I redid 1 and 2 and 																						
																						followed the design recipe. I still need to convert the 1 question and finish question 4.
																						
1-24	JD		20:00	23:00		0				1						3			Implemented the design recipe on #1 and merged several of the helper functions.	

1-27	JD		9:00	14:00		0				1						5			I implemented the design recipe and also made it so it followed the prompt. Before if movement-amount would put it outside the canvas, it would print an error.
																						I made it so it will stop at the propriate place. I also ran into a potential bug that I was not sure how to address. 
																						What happens if a robot is outside the canvas, and does an extremely large coordinate change request (say 500 movement-amount, when its initial position is barely outside the canvas). 
																						The robot would be outside the canvas, then inside the canvas, then go outside the canvas again. 
																						This is a situation I am not addressing because it will complicate the problem beyond its original intent.
