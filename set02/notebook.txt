1/29	JD		14:00		17:00			 0         			1        		180           I began working on the first problem, I realized (based on the examples and slides) how big-bang works.
																							  For now, I have used the design recipe to define the constants and data definitions and finished the world-selected? 
																							  function and began working on world-after-mouse-event

1/30	JD		9:00		13:00			0					1				240			I finished problem 1, I decided to use posns for the world structure, this made it a lot easier. 
																							I feel as if there were several hints throughout that indivaded this was the appropriate approach. 
																							Either way, it made the problem a lot easier and required a lot less helper functions.

1/31	JD	17:00			23:00			0					2				360			I began working on problem 2, seeing as we will be using the two-draggable cats for this, it doesn't seem as complicated as the first problem.
																							I contemplated using a posn for the position, but realized this would become a large amount of work wit little gain. Seeing as I will not be modifying
																							the x and y coordinates of the cats very frequently.
																							I added several additional cases to the keyevents, up, down, left and right. Ultimately this allowed me to handle every single case.
																							I also added barrier functions that strict movement to inside the canvas, exactly like I did in the first problem. However, this will only prevent movement on drag.
																							For the "bouncing" effect I'll have to do something else.

2/1		JD	9:00		12:00				0				2					180			I think I realized how to create the bouncing effect, I simply calculate what the next tick will cause x/y to be, and if its larger than the half of the cat image
																							then I restrict it to the minimum/maximum x/y coordinate. We went over this in class, I plan to follow the same formula.

2/2		JD	12:00		17:00				0				2					300			I finally completed the functional aspect of this problem. I defined several constants determining the maximum/minimum size of that the cat can go.
																							I also plan to define several constants tomorrow in minimize the size of the tests. Overall, this problem set was easier than the las.

2/3		JD	9:00		16:30				0				1,2					450			I finished checking and making sure all the corner cases were covered for problem set02. I noticed in the video that you are able to drag the cat outside the canvas in the second problem.
																							However, in mine this was ot possible because I was fixing position on drag. So resolve this, I changed the fixing position functions to on mouse-down. This made it work the way it did in the video.
																							I would also like to mention that in the video there is a 1 pixel "buffer" on the walls. My interpretation of the problem did not cal for this. I understood that the goal was to prevent the cats from going outside
																							The cat itself would not go outside.
