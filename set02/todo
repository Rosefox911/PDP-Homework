// 1. Define the minimum and maximum for x and y as constants
// 2. Redo interp for MouseEvent
3. Test cases, comment regarding what the test is testing. (i.e. robot below canvas stops after corssing into canvas)
4. Use constants for test cases so the test cases are flexible (i.e. if they change the values, the tests won't fail)
5. You CANNOT decompose two variables of the same datatype in the same function (i.e. posn)
