1. Make sure the datatypes (i.e. integer/ number) are EXACTLY as specified in the problem set.
2. Number of copies on hand = nonnegative integer
3. reorder status (both positive integers)
4. use cons? instead of else when doing the template for lists
5. Remember to add (book-fn) like so:


(define (lob-fn lob)
  (cond
    [(empty? lob) ...]
    [cons? (...
           (book-fn (first lob))
           (lob-fn (rest lob)))]))

6. DO NOT do recursion on helper functions, do it in the main function. (will be useful for next week)
