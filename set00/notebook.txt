1/10  JD		18:00	20:00           		    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10  2            Had issues with #10. Wanted to use Array ad a for loop, 
																						but couldn't figure it out. 
																						Decided to add all values, then substract them from the smallest one (thus giving the 2 largest). 
																						I did this using a helper function. 
																						I used ifs instead of cond, not sure if this is allowed but it is in the racket library so I assume its ok. 
																						I still need to add the Formula description.
